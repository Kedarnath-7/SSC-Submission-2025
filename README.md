# SSC-Submission-2025
For "Planet Healer", I aimed to create an engaging, educational, and visually appealing experience that immerses players in the mission of restoring a damaged planet. The game is designed to be intuitive, interactive, and rewarding, ensuring that players not only learn about environmental issues but also feel motivated to take action in real life.   User Experience Goals: 
Immersion & Storytelling: From the very first scene, players are introduced as recruits of the Galactic Guardians, an advanced space organisation dedicated to saving planets from ecological collapse.  The AI companion, AERON, guides the player through their mission, providing insights into the environmental problems affecting the planet.  A seamless narrative flow ensures engagement—from selecting problems to solving them and seeing the planet visibly recover with each step.  The final congratulatory scene acknowledges the player’s efforts, reinforcing their role as a “Planet Healer.”   Educational & Interactive: Instead of presenting facts in a passive way, the game introduces interactive quizzes that require players to think critically about real-world environmental issues. Each problem (e.g., deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, ocean disruption) is accompanied by scenario-based questions, encouraging players to analyse and apply what they learn. The visual representation of the planet changing in real time adds an extra layer of engagement, allowing players to see the impact of their solutions as they progress.   Motivation & Reward System: Completing all tasks grants the player the prestigious “Planet Healer” title.  The experience is designed to be rewarding and satisfying, ensuring that players feel a sense of achievement for their efforts.  The final scene encourages players to reflect on what they’ve learned and inspire change beyond the game.

Frameworks & Technologies Used: 
To achieve this experience, I leveraged SpriteKit, Swift Playgrounds, and Core Animation for smooth transitions and animations.  
SpriteKit: 
2D Game Development: Used for rendering the planet, problems, AERON, and UI elements.  Animations & Effects: Applied blinking effects, typewriter text animations, and fade transitions to enhance engagement.  Scene Transitions: Implemented smooth navigation between different game stages: ProblemSelectionScene → ProblemDetailsScene → QuizScene → CongratulateScene.   Swift Playgrounds:  Platform for Student Submissions: Ensured compatibility within Apple’s guidelines.  Optimized for Interactivity: Allowed smooth scene transitions between different phases of the game.  Efficient Testing Environment: Provided a lightweight and efficient way to test animations, interactions, and logic in a real-time environment.   Core Animation:  Seamless Scene Transitions: Enhanced storytelling and kept players engaged.  Typewriter Effect for Dialogue: Made AERON’s guidance more dynamic and interactive.  Fade In/Out Effects: Used to create an immersive experience when transitioning between different stages.   I chose SpriteKit because it is lightweight, efficient, and well-optimized for creating 2D games within the Swift Playgrounds environment. Unlike other game engines that may require heavy computations, SpriteKit ensures smooth performance and responsive interactions, making it ideal for an educational game. Additionally, Swift Playgrounds provided an accessible platform to build, test, and refine the game within the constraints of the Swift Student Challenge, ensuring that all elements were optimized for engagement, learning, and interactivity.
